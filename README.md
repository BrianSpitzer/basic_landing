# Basic Landing

## Standard Workflow

 1. Fork the repo to your own account, if it isn't already.
 1. Create a Cloud9 workspace [as described here](https://guides.firstdraft.com/getting-started-with-cloud-9.html).
 1. Click the Gear icon in the top-right corner of the Workspace to get to the Settings pane, find the Experimental section, **turn on Auto-Save**, and refresh Cloud 9.
 1. Run the command `bin/setup` in the Terminal at the bottom of the window.
 1. Click the "Run Project" button at the top of the window.
 1. In a Chrome tab, check out the live app at https://[PROJECT NAME]-[YOUR CLOUD 9 USERNAME].c9users.io
 1. Navigate to https://[PROJECT NAME]-[YOUR CLOUD 9 USERNAME].c9users.io/rails/git
 1. Create a branch for your work.
 1. Make your first change to the code. (You could modify this `README.md` file by adding your username next to the project in the heading, for example.)
 1. Create a commit.
 1. Click Push to GitHub.
 1. **Commit and Push often as you work.**
 1. Make new branches freely to experiment! You can always switch back to an older branch, and all of your files will instantly snap back to their older state. **So, when in doubt, create a branch**, _especially_ before starting on a new task.
 1. A great way to get feedback is to "Open a pull request". That will make it easy to see the changes you've made in the branch, and we can leave line-by-line comments.
